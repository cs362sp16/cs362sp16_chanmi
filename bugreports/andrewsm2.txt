lines in question:

void card_greathall(int currentPlayer, struct gameState *state, int handPos)
{
	//+1 Card
	drawCard(currentPlayer, state);
			
	//+1 Actions
	state->numActions++;
			
	//discard card from hand
	discardCard(handPos, currentPlayer, state, 0);
}

Using my card testers and my eyes I could see that the village card definitely did not function properly.
It would set numActions to numActions - 2, which is the opposite of what village does.
Setting the minus to be a plus would fix this.
