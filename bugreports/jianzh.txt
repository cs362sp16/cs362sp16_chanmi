Using my cardtester I could see that village wasn't adding one action.

His function:
int village_function(struct gameState *state, int currentPlayer, int handPos){
    drawCard(currentPlayer, state);

    state->numActions = state->numActions + 3;

    discardCard(handPos, currentPlayer, state, 0);

    return 0;
}



It seems that it adds an extra action, which sets off my assert. I think the numActions should be add two and not three.
