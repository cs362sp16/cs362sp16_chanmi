void card_smithy(int currentPlayer, struct gameState *state, int handPos)
{
	int i;

	//+3 Cards
	for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
	{
		drawCard(currentPlayer, state);
	}
			
	
}

Smithy adds three cards into the hand, but the error here is that smithy doesn't get discarded.
That means it could be played more than it should be. Adding a discard outside the for loop would fix this.
