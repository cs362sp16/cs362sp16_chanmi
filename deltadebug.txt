Alex brought a interesting delta debugging site to my attention in lecture:
https://www.st.cs.uni-saarland.de/dd/ddusage.php3

I found it again by googling "delta debugging tutorial".

The general pattern to set up delta debugging is:
1. Identify the test cases
2. Identify the deltas
3. Set up a Delta debugging framework
5. Invoke delta debugging

All the python scripts needed are on the website and I just downloaded them from there but changed bug.c to my smithy tester.
The script tries to isolate differences by changing individual characters.

In the example provided, the "trivial" test case would be the passing one and my smithy cardtest1 would be the failing.
Using the "dd" for isolating failure inducing differences with GCCDD.py, the script finished with this statement:
dd: done
The 1-minimal failure-inducing difference is [(474, '('), (475, '2'), (484, '&'), (485, 'g'), (486, ')'), (487, ';')]

The rest of the output can be seen in delta.out, which is GCCDD.py piped.
