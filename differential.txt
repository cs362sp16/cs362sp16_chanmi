I used Krisna Irawan's dominion.c for differential testing.
My testdominion.c works perfectly fine with my dominion.c. I get 60%+ coverage with just 2 runs and with 20 or so I hit 70%.

File 'dominion.c'
Lines executed:62.82% of 581
Creating 'dominion.c.gcov'

When I try running my testdom with anyone elses, it doesn't work. Usually there will be an error somewhere in the running process.
With Krisna's I can get a few turns in before it freezes on a village card. I've already spent hours on this issue and I can't fix it.
My diffdominion script should run just fine, but it doesn't get past running his executable dominion and the only reason I know 
 it gets to village is because I had to manually run the executable myself.
I tried to manually differentiate but window's command prompt's buffer size wouldn't show me the rest of the history.
Piping the output did nothing for some reason so that didn't work either.

Anyways, the main difference I could see was that village crashed on his but not on mine. His is not correct because it freezes when mines works fine.
That does not mean mines is correct either since it is most likely his is the same as mine because I don't think he changed his,
and I didn't really change mine. So no, it's not easy to decide. Also because they are both really similar I can say with confidence
 that the coverages would be really close. This is not the most ideal case for differential testing because my testdom isn't really
  compatible and dominion.c already does some weird stuff that would most likely be seen in both test cases.
