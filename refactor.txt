1----------------------

Created 5 functions for the cards: council room, smithy, village, great hall, and embargo.

This was done by copying their functionality in the cases into the functions then copying cardEffect's 

variables and adding any needed parameters.
councilCard: Takes currentPlayer, gameState, and hand position. I also moved most of the variable definitions 
	in cardEffect into this function in case it used them.
smithyCard: Takes currentPlayer, gameState, and hand position. I also moved most of the variable definitions 
	in cardEffect into this function in case it used them.
villageCard: Takes currentPlayer, gameState, and hand position. I also moved most of the variable definitions 
	in cardEffect into this function in case it used them.
gHallCard: Takes currentPlayer, gameState, and hand position. I also moved most of the variable definitions 
	in cardEffect into this function in case it used them.
embargoCard: Takes currentPlayer, gameState, choice1, and hand position. I also moved most of the variable definitions 
	in cardEffect into this function in case it used them.
Moved the functions to their respective cases in the function cardEffect().
