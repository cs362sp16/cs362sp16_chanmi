1----------------------
Created 5 functions for the cards: council room, smithy, village, great hall, and embargo.
This was done by copying their functionality in the cases into the functions then copying cardEffect's
variables and adding any needed parameters.
Moved the functions to their respective cases in the function cardEffect().
